Reinforcement learning is based on learning though the interaction with the environment given a specific goal. 

Reinforcement Learning goal is to find the policy that maximices the reward.
In RL definition we find Markov Decision Proecesses as the design and conceptual implementation. Shown bellow is the perception-action-learning-loop
The environment interacts with the agent in a given state, and thanks to the policy it returns the best possible action

This is the result of the scripted agent running in HallucinIce SC2 map with Archon unit
